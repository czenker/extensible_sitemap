extension "extensible_sitemap"
     ______________________________________________________________________________________

Introduction

What does it do?

   This extension is yet another sitemap generator for search engines.

   The main thing that makes this extension special from all the other implementations is that
   it is extensible. With the other extensions you have no possibility to add pages generated
   by your extension. (except by really nasty XCLASSing, but what if there are two or more
   extensions trying to XCLASS?) So this extension has an interface where you can add your
   extensions to the sitemap generator.

   It is also possible to generate multiple sitemaps. So if you have a gallery extension with
   multiple galleries you could stuff all the gallery pages in the default sitemap and create
   an additional image sitemap for google to make the images available in the Google Image
   Search.
